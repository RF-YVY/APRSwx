# APRSwx Bug Fixes and Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ APRS-IS Connection Status Indication
**Problem**: Header showed "disconnected" with yellow icon even when settings showed connected and stations were being received.

**Root Cause**: The connection status was using only the settings state, not the actual WebSocket connection state.

**Solution**:
- Updated `ConnectionStatus.tsx` to use the actual `aprsIsConnected` state from WebSocket context
- Added distinction between WebSocket connection and APRS-IS connection
- Updated `UserSettingsSimple.tsx` to use actual connection state for the toggle button
- Added `sendAPRSISConnect` and `sendAPRSISDisconnect` methods to WebSocket context
- Updated connection status messages for clarity

**Files Modified**:
- `ConnectionStatus.tsx` - Fixed connection status logic
- `UserSettingsSimple.tsx` - Synced APRS-IS toggle with actual state
- `WebSocketContext.tsx` - Added APRS-IS connection methods to context
- `types/aprs.ts` - Added methods to WebSocketContextType interface

### 2. ✅ Dark Mode Text Contrast Issues
**Problem**: Text in packet statistics panels and info bubbles was hard to read in dark mode.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced dark mode CSS for improved text contrast
- Added specific dark theme styles for:
  - Packet statistics panels
  - Station detail panels  
  - Weather info sections
  - Leaflet popups and tooltips
  - Form elements and buttons
- Improved color contrast ratios for better accessibility

**Files Modified**:
- `App.css` - Added comprehensive dark mode contrast improvements

### 3. ✅ Duplicate Station Info Bubbles
**Problem**: Clicking on station marker showed two info bubbles - both Leaflet popup and custom station detail panel.

**Solution**:
- Removed the Leaflet popup from station markers
- Enhanced the station detail panel with all information previously shown in popup
- Added weather data display to the station detail panel
- Improved positioning and styling of the station detail panel

**Files Modified**:
- `APRSMap.tsx` - Removed duplicate popup, enhanced station detail panel
- `App.css` - Added station detail panel styling and positioning

### 4. ✅ TNC Connection Status Added
**Problem**: No TNC connection status was shown in the header.

**Solution**:
- Updated `ConnectionStatus.tsx` to show both APRS-IS and TNC connection status
- Added dual connection indicators with separate status messages
- TNC shows as "Disconnected" (not implemented yet)
- Added proper styling for dual connection display

**Files Modified**:
- `ConnectionStatus.tsx` - Added TNC connection status display
- `App.css` - Added styling for dual connection indicators

### 5. ✅ App Log Window Added
**Problem**: No way for users to see active backend/server data and debugging information.

**Solution**:
- Created new `AppLogViewer.tsx` component
- Features:
  - Real-time log viewing with different log levels (info, warning, error, debug)
  - Filtering by log level
  - Auto-scroll option
  - Connection state monitoring
  - Data update logging
  - Clear log functionality
  - Responsive modal design
- Added log viewer toggle button to header
- Integrated with WebSocket context for real-time updates

**Files Modified**:
- `AppLogViewer.tsx` - New component for log viewing
- `App.tsx` - Added log viewer to header
- `App.css` - Added comprehensive log viewer styling

## UI/UX Improvements
