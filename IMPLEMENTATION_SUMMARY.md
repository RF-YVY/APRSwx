# APRSwx Enhanced Features Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of advanced user-centric features for the APRSwx full-stack application, including distance-based station filtering, TNC settings, MRMS radar integration, and improved UI/UX.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Distance-Based Station Filtering
- **Backend**: Updated `WeatherRadarService` to use MRMS (Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor) system
- **Frontend**: Enhanced `StationList` component to filter stations by distance from user location
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added `maxDistance` prop to `StationList` component
  - Modified filtering logic to respect distance limits from user settings
  - Integration with user location (GPS, manual, or map-click)

### 2. MRMS Weather Radar Integration
- **Source**: Updated to use https://mrms.ncep.noaa.gov/ for radar data
- **Products**: Support for multiple MRMS products (reflectivity, velocity, precipitation, etc.)
- **Implementation**:
  - Replaced NEXRAD with MRMS in `radar_service.py`
  - Updated API endpoints to use `product_id` instead of `site_id`
  - Added WMS overlay URL generation for direct MRMS access
  - Modified frontend radar service to handle MRMS products

### 3. TNC (Terminal Node Controller) Settings
- **Complete TNC Configuration Panel**:
  - Enable/disable TNC interface
  - Serial port selection (COM1-8, /dev/ttyUSB0, etc.)
  - Baud rate selection (1200-115200)
  - Audio input/output device configuration
  - PTT (Push-to-Talk) method selection (VOX, CAT, RTS, DTR)
  - PTT pin/port configuration
  - Real-time status display

### 4. Enhanced User Settings Panel
- **Improved UI/UX**:
  - Made settings panel larger and scrollable within itself
  - Prevents scrolling the entire application
  - Added comprehensive user setup validation
  - Enhanced visual feedback and status indicators

### 5. User Location Management
- **Multiple Location Input Methods**:
  - Manual latitude/longitude entry
  - GPS location detection
  - Map click selection
  - Location accuracy and source tracking

### 6. APRS-IS Connection Control
- **Smart Connection Management**:
  - Only allows connection after complete setup
  - Validates callsign, passcode, location, and distance filter
  - Manual connect/disconnect controls
  - Real-time connection status display

### 7. Distance Unit Support
- **Flexible Unit System**:
  - Support for both kilometers and miles
  - Consistent unit display across all components
  - User preference persistence

## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### Weather Radar Service (`backend/weather/radar_service.py`)
```python
# Updated to use MRMS system
class WeatherRadarService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mrms_base_url = 'https://mrms.ncep.noaa.gov/data'
        self.mrms_products = {
            'reflectivity': 'MergedReflectivityQComposite',
            'velocity': 'MergedAzShear',
            'precipitation': 'PrecipRate',
            # ... additional products
        }
```

#### API Endpoints (`backend/weather/views.py`)
- Updated `RadarSitesView` to return MRMS products
- Modified `RadarDataView` to handle product-based requests
- Enhanced `RadarOverlayView` to support WMS URLs

#### URL Configuration (`backend/weather/urls.py`)
- Changed from `site_id` to `product_id` parameters
- Updated endpoint naming for MRMS compatibility

### Frontend Changes

#### Station Filtering (`frontend/src/components/StationList.tsx`)
```typescript
// Enhanced distance filtering
if (userLocation && station.latitude && station.longitude) {
  const distance = calculateStationDistance(station);
  const maxDistanceKm = maxDistance || filter.within_km;
  if (maxDistanceKm !== undefined && distance > maxDistanceKm) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

#### TNC Settings (`frontend/src/components/UserSettings.tsx`)
- Complete TNC configuration interface
- Serial port and baud rate selection
- Audio device configuration
- PTT method selection
- Status monitoring and display

#### Radar Service (`frontend/src/services/radarService.ts`)
- Updated to work with MRMS products instead of NEXRAD sites
- Support for both WMS URLs and base64 image data
- Enhanced error handling and caching

#### Type Definitions (`frontend/src/types/radar.ts`)
- Updated to support both legacy NEXRAD and new MRMS formats
- Flexible property definitions for backward compatibility
- Enhanced overlay type with multiple data sources
