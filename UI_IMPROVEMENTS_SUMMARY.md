# UI/UX Improvements Summary

## âœ… COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. Settings Window Arrangement
- **Issue**: SSID field placement was acceptable as separate field
- **Status**: âœ… Already properly arranged (no changes needed)
- **Result**: SSID field remains separate from callsign field

### 2. Weather Radar Dropdown Simplification
- **Issue**: Non-functional weather radar product dropdown
- **Fix**: Removed complex product selection system
- **Changes**:
  - Simplified `RadarControls.tsx` by removing product grid
  - Removed unused imports and functions
  - Kept basic radar toggle and opacity controls
  - Added simple product info display
- **Result**: âœ… Clean, functional radar controls without broken dropdown

### 3. Weather Observations & Severe Weather Alerts
- **Issue**: Empty weather observations section
- **Fix**: Added real weather alerts service
- **Changes**:
  - Created `weatherAlertsService.ts` using National Weather Service API
  - Updated `WeatherPanel.tsx` to fetch and display weather alerts
  - Added location-based and national severe weather alerts
  - Enhanced alert display with severity indicators and area information
- **Result**: âœ… Weather panel now shows active severe weather alerts

### 4. Dark Mode Application-Wide
- **Issue**: Dark mode toggle only affected limited components
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive dark mode CSS
- **Changes**:
  - Added extensive dark mode styles to `App.css`
  - Covered all major components (settings, stations, weather, etc.)
  - Applied dark theme to form elements, buttons, panels
  - Fixed color scheme for dark backgrounds
- **Result**: âœ… Dark mode now affects entire application

### 5. APRS-IS Connection Status Discrepancy
- **Issue**: Settings showed connected but header showed disconnected
- **Fix**: Separated WebSocket connection from APRS-IS connection status
- **Changes**:
  - Added `aprsIsConnected` state to WebSocket context
  - Updated `WebSocketContextType` interface
  - Modified `ConnectionStatus.tsx` to show correct APRS-IS status
  - Added proper status handling for backend vs APRS-IS connections
- **Result**: âœ… Header now correctly shows APRS-IS connection status
