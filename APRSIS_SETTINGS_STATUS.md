# APRS-IS Connection & Persistent Settings - Fixes Applied

## ✅ Issues Addressed

### 1. **APRS-IS Data Not Coming In**

**Analysis**: The APRS-IS connection mechanism was successfully implemented in previous fixes, but there may be an issue with the WebSocket message handling or the frontend not properly triggering the connection.

**Status**: ✅ Backend service working, needs frontend integration testing

**Evidence**:
- `backend/test_aprs_service.py` shows APRS-IS connection works
- `backend/websockets/aprs_service.py` successfully connects and receives packets
- Backend WebSocket consumer properly handles `connect_aprsis` messages

**Next Steps**: Verify frontend is sending connection requests properly

### 2. **Persistent User Settings**

**Analysis**: Created multiple approaches for persistent settings storage.

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### Option A: Hook-based approach
- ✅ Created `frontend/src/hooks/useUserSettings.ts` 
- Uses localStorage to persist settings
- Provides `settings`, `updateSettings`, `resetSettings`

#### Option B: Context-based approach  
- ✅ Created `frontend/src/context/SettingsContext.tsx`
- React Context with localStorage persistence
- Simpler integration with existing components

#### Option C: Simplified component
- ✅ Created `frontend/src/components/UserSettingsSimple.tsx`
- Uses SettingsContext internally
- Reduced complexity, focused on core functionality

## 🔧 Code Changes Made

### Backend (APRS-IS Connection)
- ✅ `backend/websockets/aprs_service.py` - Background APRS-IS connection service
- ✅ `backend/websockets/consumers.py` - WebSocket handlers for connect/disconnect
- ✅ `backend/aprs_server/settings.py` - APRS-IS configuration settings
- ✅ Test scripts verify APRS-IS connection works

### Frontend (Persistent Settings)
- ✅ `frontend/src/context/SettingsContext.tsx` - Settings with localStorage persistence
- ✅ `frontend/src/hooks/useUserSettings.ts` - Alternative hook-based approach
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/UserSettingsSimple.tsx` - Simplified settings UI
- ✅ `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Updated to use persistent settings

## 🚧 Integration Status

### Working Components
- ✅ Backend APRS-IS connection service
- ✅ Settings persistence to localStorage
- ✅ Radar overlay functionality (from previous fixes)

### Needs Testing/Integration
- ⚠️ Frontend WebSocket connection to backend
- ⚠️ Complete App.tsx integration with new settings
- ⚠️ UserSettingsSimple component styling
- ⚠️ End-to-end APRS-IS connection from frontend

## 🧪 Verification Steps

### APRS-IS Connection
1. ✅ Backend service connects to APRS-IS successfully
2. ✅ Backend service receives and parses packets
3. ✅ Backend WebSocket consumer handles connection requests
4. ❓ Frontend sends connection requests (needs verification)
5. ❓ End-to-end connection flow works (needs testing)

### Persistent Settings
1. ✅ Settings save to localStorage automatically
2. ✅ Settings load from localStorage on app start
3. ✅ Settings context provides state management
4. ❓ Complete UI integration (in progress)

## 🎯 Next Actions

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. **Test WebSocket Connection**: Verify frontend sends APRS-IS connection requests
2. **Complete App Integration**: Finish App.tsx integration with new settings
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete APRS-IS connection flow

### Short Term
1. **UI Polish**: Complete UserSettingsSimple styling
2. **Error Handling**: Add better error messages for connection failures
3. **Settings Validation**: Ensure all required settings are validated

### Medium Term
1. **Performance**: Optimize packet processing for high-traffic areas
2. **Features**: Add more station filtering options
3. **Mobile**: Improve mobile responsiveness

## 📊 Current State

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| APRS-IS Backend | ✅ Working | Connects, receives packets |
| WebSocket Handlers | ✅ Working | Handles connect/disconnect |
| Settings Persistence | ✅ Working | localStorage integration |
| Frontend Integration | 🔄 In Progress | App.tsx updates needed |
| End-to-End Flow | ❓ Unknown | Needs testing |

## 🔍 Debugging Approach

If APRS-IS still doesn't work after integration:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for WebSocket connection errors
2. **Check Django Logs**: Verify backend receives connection requests  
3. **Test Direct Connection**: Use test scripts to verify backend works
4. **Check Settings**: Ensure callsign, passcode, location are valid
5. **Network Issues**: Verify firewall/proxy doesn't block connections

The foundation is solid - both APRS-IS connection and persistent settings have working implementations. The remaining work is primarily integration and testing.
