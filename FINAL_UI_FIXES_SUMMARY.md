# APRSwx Final Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved ✅

### 1. APRS-IS WebSocket Connection Error
**Problem**: WebSocket connection returning "not connected" error when trying to connect to APRS-IS
**Root Cause**: The `sendAPRSISConnect` function was not properly checking WebSocket state and had insufficient error handling
**Solution**:
- Enhanced WebSocket state checking in `sendAPRSISConnect()` function
- Added proper error messages when WebSocket is not ready
- Improved logging to show what data is being sent
- Added better timeout handling for connection attempts

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/context/WebSocketContext.tsx`

**Changes**:
```typescript
// Before: Basic check that could fail silently
if (wsRef.current?.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {

// After: Explicit check with clear error message
if (!wsRef.current || wsRef.current.readyState !== WebSocket.OPEN) {
  notificationService.error('Connection Error', 'WebSocket is not connected. Please wait for connection.');
  return;
}
```

### 2. Sidebar Hide/Show Functionality
**Problem**: 
- When sidebar was hidden, there was no way to bring it back
- Map didn't expand to full width when sidebar was hidden
- Missing UI controls for sidebar toggle

**Solution**:
- Added "Show Sidebar" button that appears when sidebar is hidden
- Enhanced CSS for proper layout transitions
- Added sidebar header with hide button
- Implemented smooth transitions for better UX

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/App.css` (Added comprehensive sidebar styling)
