# Debug and Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **APRS-IS Data Not Coming In**

**Problem**: The frontend WebSocket would connect but no APRS-IS data was being received because there was no mechanism to actually start the APRS-IS connection.

**Root Cause**: The WebSocket consumer was expecting data from the database, but there was no service to connect to APRS-IS and populate the database.

**Solution**:
- Created `backend/websockets/aprs_service.py` - A background service that handles APRS-IS connections
- Updated `backend/websockets/consumers.py` - Added APRS-IS connection handling to the APRSConsumer
- Updated `frontend/src/context/WebSocketContext.tsx` - Added logic to send connection requests to backend
- Added Django settings for APRS-IS connection parameters

**Key Changes**:
- `APRSISConnectionService` class that runs APRS-IS connection in background thread
- WebSocket message handlers for `connect_aprsis` and `disconnect_aprsis`
- Frontend functions `sendAPRSISConnect()` and `sendAPRSISDisconnect()`
- Proper APRS-IS protocol handling with login response parsing
- Real-time packet processing and WebSocket broadcasting

**Test Results**:
- APRS-IS connection now works successfully
- Packets are being received and parsed
- Station and packet data is being broadcasted to frontend via WebSocket

### 2. ✅ **Radar Overlay Broken Image**

**Problem**: The radar overlay was showing as a broken image because the WMS service URLs were not working correctly.

**Root Cause**: The original WMS service (NOAA nowcoast) was not accessible or had authentication issues.

**Solution**:
- Updated `backend/weather/radar_service.py` to use Iowa Environmental Mesonet WMS service
- Added fallback to NWS Ridge II radar images
- Improved URL generation with better error handling
- Added comprehensive testing for radar overlay URLs

**Key Changes**:
- Changed WMS service to `https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/cgi-bin/wms/nexrad/n0r.cgi`
- Updated WMS parameters to use working format (WMS 1.1.1)
- Added fallback to `https://radar.weather.gov/ridge/standard/CONUS_0.gif`
- Improved error handling and logging

**Test Results**:
- Radar overlay URLs are now accessible (HTTP 200 status)
- Both WMS and fallback radar images work correctly
- Backend endpoint `/api/weather/radar-overlay/reflectivity/` returns valid URLs

## Technical Implementation

### APRS-IS Connection Flow
1. User enables APRS-IS connection in settings
2. Frontend WebSocket sends `connect_aprsis` message with user settings
3. Backend `APRSConsumer` receives message and starts `APRSISConnectionService`
4. Service connects to APRS-IS server with proper login protocol
5. Background thread receives packets and processes them
6. Packets are saved to database and broadcasted via WebSocket
7. Frontend receives updates and displays stations/packets

### Radar Overlay Flow
1. Frontend requests radar overlay for map bounds
2. Backend `RadarOverlayView` receives request
3. Service generates Iowa Mesonet WMS URL with bounds
4. If WMS fails, fallback to NWS Ridge II national radar
5. Frontend receives working radar image URL
6. Map displays radar overlay as image tile

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/websockets/aprs_service.py` (new) - APRS-IS connection service
- `backend/websockets/consumers.py` - Added APRS-IS connection handling
- `backend/weather/radar_service.py` - Fixed radar overlay URLs
- `backend/aprs_server/settings.py` - Added APRS-IS settings
- `backend/test_radar_overlay.py` (new) - Radar overlay test script
- `backend/test_aprs_service.py` (new) - APRS-IS connection test script

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/context/WebSocketContext.tsx` - Added APRS-IS connection logic
- No other frontend changes needed - existing code handles the data flow

## Verification

### APRS-IS Connection
✅ Connection establishes successfully
✅ Packets are received and parsed  
✅ Station data is populated in database
✅ Real-time updates via WebSocket
✅ Proper error handling and status reporting

### Radar Overlay
✅ WMS URLs are accessible (HTTP 200)
✅ Fallback URLs work correctly
✅ API endpoint returns valid responses
✅ Both bounded and national radar images work

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Real User Settings**: Use actual callsign and passcode
2. **Monitor Performance**: Check for any memory leaks or connection issues
3. **Add More Error Handling**: Improve resilience for network issues
4. **Optimize Packet Processing**: Consider rate limiting for high-traffic areas
5. **Add More Radar Products**: Implement velocity, precipitation, etc.

## User Experience Improvements

With these fixes:
- ✅ APRS-IS connection now works as expected
- ✅ Station list populates with real data when connected
- ✅ Radar overlay shows current weather conditions
- ✅ Real-time updates provide live APRS activity
- ✅ Manual connection control gives users full control

The application now provides a complete, working APRS client with weather radar integration.
